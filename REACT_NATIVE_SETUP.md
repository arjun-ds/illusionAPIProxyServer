# üö® REACT NATIVE SETUP üö®

This is a proxy server for securing Deepgram API access from your React Native app.

## QUICK SETUP

1. **Deploy this server** to AWS App Runner
2. **Update your React Native code** with just ONE change:

```java
// In AudioManager.java, change only the WebSocket URL
Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url("wss://your-app-runner-service.awsapprunner.com")  // Your AWS service URL
    .build();
```

That's it! Your app will now connect securely without exposing your Deepgram API key.

## WHY THIS MATTERS

- ‚úÖ Your Deepgram API key stays secure on the server
- ‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized API usage and potential billing issues
- ‚úÖ Works with your existing React Native implementation
- ‚úÖ No changes to your app's functionality
